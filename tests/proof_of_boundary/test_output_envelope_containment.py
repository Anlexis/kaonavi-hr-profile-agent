# PB (containment): what the caller-facing envelope carries after the output
# gate refuses a response, or after the inner workflow fails.
#
# The envelope resolves its payload as `formatted_output or result` and never
# looks at the status; by the time post_process runs, `result` already holds
# the inner workflow's answer. So an error return that merely sets the status,
# or that replaces formatted_output with something falsy, ships the answer it
# refused inside an envelope that calls itself an error.
#
# These tests assert the property at the boundary that matters: on every
# non-success path the envelope the caller receives carries closed-set labels
# only - never error_log, never the gate's violation entries, never record
# evidence - and stays truthy. The clean-path control is deliberate: it fails
# if the gate ever starts refusing everything, so containment cannot be
# "achieved" by returning nothing at all.
#
# post_process is driven through its real call path where the framework
# pipeline allows (node(state) - trust gate, input gate, execute, credential
# scan) and its returned partial state is merged the way the state reducer
# merges it (error_log / node_history append); an errored state is driven
# through execute(), because BaseNode.__call__ short-circuits on it and the
# backbone routes an error straight to finalize, so that branch is only
# reachable from inside. The merged state is then projected through the
# agent's own get_output(), which is exactly what the caller reads.
