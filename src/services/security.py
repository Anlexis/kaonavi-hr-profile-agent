"""Input sanitizing helpers for CMN-C2-273.

Pure, stateless domain helpers (NOT framework gate methods), shared by the
outer backbone pre_process and the inner validate step so that BOTH caller
text channels - the instruction text and anything decoded out of the
structured caller fields - get the same treatment.

That sharing is the point. The framework's own input scan covers the
instruction text but not the structured caller channel, so a screen wired only
into the instruction path would leave caller-supplied text unscreened.

# prompt/instruction noun, or a model role), or on a chat-template control
# token, which has no legitimate reading in an HR-profile request.
#
# This screen is the template's own guarantee, not the framework's: a platform
# input gate exists only on some host versions, covers only
